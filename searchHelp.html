	<h2>How to use Search</h2>
	<p>
		The purpose of the Search is to allow the user to search a folder, or folders, that contains DICOM files.
		<br><br>
		There are 3 search criteria that can be used; these are:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Patient Name</li>
			<li>Body Part Examined</li>
			<li>Acquisition Date</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h2>Starting the search:-</h2>
	<p>
		By default all the search options above are disabled; to enable the search, check the box beside the item for which you wish to search.<br>
		For instance; to perform a search for "Patient Name", check the box beside it.  
		The search areas for "First Name" and "Last Name" are now enabled and you can type the search criteria into them.
		<br><br>
		You can perform wilcard searches by entering the following symbols: <br>
		<i>Note: These examples are for "First Name", you can use the same criteria for "Last Name"</i>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Joe* 
			<ul><li>this will return a list of patients where the First Name starts with "Joe"</li></ul>
		</li>
		<li>*mith
			<ul><li>this will return a list of patients where the First Name ends with "mith"</li></ul>
